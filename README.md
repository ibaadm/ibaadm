## Hi there, I'm Ibaad 👋

I'm a first year Computer Science student at UCL and a developer interested in SWE and ML. My main languages are Python and C#, but I also have experience with Java, C/C++ and JavaScript. I'm currently working on polishing and publishing [Typocalypse](https://github.com/ibaadm/typocalypse), along with some other projects you can view on my github. 

If you're interested, I'd love to chat! Here's my LinkedIn.
